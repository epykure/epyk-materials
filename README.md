### Epyk with Materials UI!

An easy way to use Epyk with the Material Components extension.

Presentation
================================
This package will make a simple interface between most of the components of Materials components
and Epyk. This addon will allow you to benefit from the two world and to keep write Interactive and modern web pages from Python.

Concept
=======

Wrapper on top of the Epyk core module to add extra features and shortcuts on Material web components.

Those components are only wrapped on top of generic Epyk components (Epyk Composite component) and this will ensure
interaction between those components.

</div>

More details on those components are directly available on the [official website](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) 

This will only provide easy wrappers and automated way to add standard actions from Python.
More complex or bespoke logic might require improvements in this library.

Usage
=======

To use this extra package, it is required to import it directly. it will use Epyk core module as underlying and this
wrapper will add material entry point to the page object.

This entry point will be the one to rely on the various components.
